# **Dice endgames**
### Description
Dice endgames is a gambling and logical game, at the same time being a variety of both chess and checkers-like games and dice. In this game, the arrangement of chess pieces depends on the values on the faces of the dice. It was conceived as teaching and training how to solve endgames, problems or random arrangements, such as Fischer's chess, in various board games of logic.
### Rules
By throwing three dice (using a game glass), the name of the piece is determined, and the coordinates of that piece on the board â€” according to the notation for chess, draughts and makruk, qipu for xiangqi and janggi, kifu for shogi and also kifu for go. It can be used for any variants of chess, checkers, and similar board games where the boards have coordinates. There is also a game with an additional dice, the throw of which sets the number of pieces or pairs of pieces on the game board. The initial rolls are for major pieces, such as kings in chess and makruk, generals in xiangqi and janggi, or royal generals in shogi; since there are none in checkers, you can stipulate dames, or get by with those checkers that fall on the last diagonal of the checkerboard. In the event that the arrangement obtained after the next throw violates the rules of this game, a reroll is carried out. Accordingly, after the placement of the pieces, the game with incomplete information is transformed into a game with complete information.
