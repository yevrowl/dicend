**Dice endgames** is a gambling and logical game with perfect information, at the same time being a variety of both variants of chess and checkers-like games, and dices. In this game, the arrangement of chess pieces depends on the values on the sides of the dice.[1] It was conceived as teaching and training how to solve endgames, problems or random arrangements, such as Fischer's chess, in various board games of logic.
