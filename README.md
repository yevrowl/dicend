Cubic endgames — ♚ ♛ ♜ ♝ ♞ ♟ ♙ ♘ ♗ ♖ ♕ ♔

Description

Cubic endgames are a gambling and logical ruen game, at the same time being a variety of both chess and checkers, and cubes. In this game, the placement of chess pieces depends on the values on the edges of the dice. Conceived as teaching and training in solving endgames, problems or random arrangements (Fischer's chess) in various board logic games.

Rules

A roll of three dice (by means of a game cup) determines the name of the piece, and its coordinates on the board - according to algebraic notation for chess, drafts and macruk, tsipu for xiangqi and changi, kifu for shogi. It can be used for any version of chess, checkers, and similar board games, where the boards have coordinates. It also offers a game with an additional die, the throw of which sets the number of pieces or pairs of pieces on the game board. The starting throws are major pieces such as kings in chess and makruk, generals in xiangqi and changi, or royal generals in shogi; since there are no such drafts in the drafts, it is possible to stipulate the setting of the dames, or to dispense with those drafts that fall on the last diagonal of the drafts board. In the event that the arrangement obtained after the next throw violates the rules of this game, a transfer is made.

Kits

The set for ordinary chess includes a standard chessboard and pieces, two 8-sided cubes, respectively with letters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) and digital (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , 6, 7, 8) designations, as well as the usual 6-sided cube, with the designations of the figures on the faces. It is possible to use a standard 6-sided cube, with points on the edges, then: ⚀ - king, ⚁ - queen, ⚂ - bishop, ⚃ - knight, ⚄ - rook, ⚅ - pawn. As cubes are suitable both from sets for AD&D games, and virtual ones.

The set for the makruk matches the chess set, and for example the ouk-khmer variant is partially borrowed from the shogi.

For a set of xiangqi variants and changi variants, you will need a game board and pieces of the selected option, as well as cubes, according to the number of faces, suitable for this option of the game board and types of pieces. For example, for classical xiangqi, these are two 9-sided cubes (9 × 10 board) with symbols on the faces from A to I and from 1 to 0 (10), respectively 9-sided and 10-sided cubes, as well as a 7-sided cube for choice of figures: 1 - general, 2 - adviser, 3 - elephant, 4 - knight, 5 - rook, 6 - gun, 7 - pawn.

The set for shogi variants contains the corresponding shogiban, a set of figures, and cubes, according to the number of faces, suitable for the given variant of the game board and types of figures. For example, for classic shogi, these are two 9-sided cubes (9 × 9 shogiban) with designations on the faces AI and 1-9, one 8-sided and 2-sided (ordinary, having 3 designations 1 and 2 on the sides) cubes for 8 kinds of figures. For figures, the first dice displays the name of the figure: 1 - royal general, 2 - gold general, 3 - silver general, 4 - elephant, 5 - horse, 6 - rook, 7 - spear, 8 - pawn; the second cube shows whether the figure is: 1 - normal, 2 - inverted.

If we consider the complement for options for drafts, then this is the corresponding checkerboard and the number of drafts, as well as suitable cubes. For russian, english and similar drafts, these are two 8-sided dice for coordinates and one 2-sided dice for figures: 1 - a lady, 2 - a checker; for international drafts differs in that both coordinate cubes are 10-sided. If an unsuitable coordinate appears, on white cells instead of black ones, a transfer should follow.
